Payroll Management in Excel using formulas and overtime logic
# ðŸ§¾ Payroll Management Dashboard (Excel)

This project simulates a payroll system for a fictional company. I created a list of employees with assigned roles and hourly wages, tracked their hours worked, and calculated total pay, including overtime where applicable.

### ðŸ”§ Skills Applied:
- Excel formulas (`IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `SUM`, `MULTIPLY`)
- Conditional logic (overtime calculations)
- Table formatting and data validation

### ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:
A clear, functional payroll dashboard that automates employee payment summaries based on hours worked.
